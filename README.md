ABOUT

This is a simple sokoban game I made to practice programming in assembly.
The code is sloppy, and there aren't many features, but it's my first real
assembly project.

It assembles into an 8k MSX cart. rom, and has a whole 3 levels! More can
easily be appended to the end of the code, I'm just not that into
sokoban - plus, it works a bit different to typical sokoban, in that once
boxes are moved onto a slot, they cannot be moved but the player can move
onto them.

It can be assembled with pasmo, z80asm and probably some other z80 assemblers
that I haven't tried.

HOW TO PLAY

arrows - movement
r - restart level
s - skip to next level

It should run on any MSX emulator, so long as it doesn't have trouble loading
a cartridge and automatically running a program.
